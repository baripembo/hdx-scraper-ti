  The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) scores and ranks 180 countries and territories worldwide based on how corrupt a countryâ€™s public sector is perceived to be by experts and business executives. It is a composite index, a combination of at least 3 and up to 13 surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The results are given on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide.
